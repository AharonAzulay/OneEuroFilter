# 1€ Filter (One Euro Filter)
A simple Python implementation of the 1€ Filter (1e filter, 1 euro filter, One Euro Filter). The code can be used as pseudocode for implementing the algorithm in other languages. Detailed pseudocode about the underlying mathematics of the algorithm and sources can be found in a blog post that I wrote about it, [Noise Filtering Using 1€ Filter](https://jaantollander.com/noise-filtering-using-one-euro-filter.html).
